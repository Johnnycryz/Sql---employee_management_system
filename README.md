# Sql---employee_management_system

After few months f learning and studying SQL, I wasn't to get my hands dirty, I want to build project for my portfolio and test my knowledge on different syntax in SQL.  

I started thinking of simple project examples that can be relatable with everyday use, so I went on twitter to do some research and see what others are doing. I saw a pot form @ezekiel_alek posted on August 31, 2024 which is an infographics on different projects to build based on skill level from Basic to Expert. 

I choose EMPLOYEE MANAGEMENT SYSTEM from the basic category because having being a full time employee in the manufacturing industries for 7years, I can easily relate with the data and possibly draw insights more readily from it.

After choosing the type of project, I need to decide whether to build the database from the ground-up or I can find a ready to use database with employee data. If I should use an already build db, I won't be able to practice how to create database or modify database. This made me choose to build the database from the scratch.
Now, I need to decide what are the data that will be inside my employee database. 

I checked on MySQL website and found a schema for an employee database. The schema contains 6 tables
i) Employees table
2) dept_emp
3) salaries
4) departments
5) dept_manager
6) titles
I used ChatGpt to generate dummy data, which I then use to create my database on SQL.
